miniExpress
===========

a simplified express module  crated with nodejs.
This is a project we (me and my partner amichai07) did in the course Advanced Internet Technologies (67555)
in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
The goal was to create a dynamic server on the nodejs platform, 
which will support very similar functionalities tot thos that the Express middelware module contains.
